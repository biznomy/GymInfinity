   'fvoct': [{"title":"Barbell Bench Press","description":"Why it's on the list: You can generate the most power with barbell lifts, so the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most weight. It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. The exercise is easy to spot and relatively easy to learn (if not master), There are plenty of bench-press programs you can follow to increase your strength.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-1-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Flat Bench Dumbbell Press","description":"Why it's on the list: With dumbbells, each side of your body must work independently, which recruits more stabilizer muscles; dumbbells are harder to control than a barbell. Dumbbells also allow for a longer range of motion than the barbell bench press, both at the bottom and top of the movement. Flat dumbbell presses allow you to hoist a fairly heavy weight, and they make for a good alternative if you've been stuck on the barbell bench for ages.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-2-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Low-Incline Barbell Bench Press ","description":"Why it's on the list: Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which requires a larger contribution from the front delts than the chest to move the weight.[2] If possible, go for a less-steep incline to hit the upper pecs without as much stress on the delts. You can also easily do low-incline benches with an adjustable bench on the Smith machine.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-3-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Machine Decline Press","description":"Why it's on the list: Some machines, like Hammer Strength, allow you to move each arm independently, which is a great feature on chest day. Besides doing a machine decline press straight on, you can sit sideways on the apparatus and press across your body one arm at a time, which delivers a completely different feel than when you sit straight-on.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-3-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Seated Machine Chest Press ","description":"Why it's on the list: Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great, but the machine press has some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-4-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Incline Dumbbell Press ","description":"Why it's on the list: Dumbbell presses make everybody's top 10 list, but with an adjustable bench you can do a number of things you can't with a fixed bench. Our favorite: changing the angle of the incline from one set to the next, or from one workout to the next. Hitting a muscle from varying degrees of incline angles builds it more thoroughly.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-5-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Dips For Chest","description":"Why it's on the list: First off, make sure you're doing dips that emphasize the pecs: Put your feet up behind you, lean forward as far as possible, and allow your elbows to flare out as you dip. Chest dips are a great spotter-free alternative to the decline press.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-6-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Incline Bench Cable Fly","description":"Why it's on the list: Not many single-joint exercises made the list, but this is one of our favorites. It's an effective move to isolate the pecs after completing your multijoint exercises. Cables allow for continuous tension throughout the exercise's full range of motion. If you've got a good chest pump going, nothing beats looking back at yourself in the mirror as you squeeze out a few more reps.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-7-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Incline Dumbbell Pull-Over","description":"Why it's on the list: Forget flat-bench pull-overs; the incline version puts your chest fibers under tension for a longer range of motion! Just sit back against a bench inclined to about 45 degrees and make sure the dumbbell clears the top. Make sure you keep this a single-joint movement; don't bend or extend at the elbows.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-8-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Pec-Deck Machine ","description":"Why it's on the list: Chest flyes are hard for many trainees to learn with dumbbells or cables because the arms need to be locked in a slightly bent position for the duration of the exercise. Luckily, the pec deck simplifies things because it allows you to work in only one pathway. So, this exercise is a great movement teacher, and you can go for a great pump without having to balance any weights.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/july/10-best-chest-exercises-for-building-muscle-v2-8-640xh.jpg"]}],

It's considered a bit more of a whole-body movement for developing explosiveness, so you lose some of the isolation effect if you do this same movement seated. With the barbell atop your upper chest, bend your knees slightly and explode upward on the balls of your feet while pressing the bar overhead.

That makes it a better isolation movement, but this movement still isn't considered an isolation exercise. In fact, it's a highly demanding multijoint overhead press that, because it's not seated, still allows for a bit of momentum as well as increased muscle activation compared to the seated version.[1],Keep the bar just off your upper chest, and press straight overhead, stopping just short of lockout. Maintain a slight bend in your knees to absorb subtle changes in your center of gravity and relieve some of the stress on your lower back. We included both the barbell and dumbbell here.

For rear delts, that same row scored the same as the seated rear-delt raise in terms of activation but significantly higher than the other eight exercises, though none of them would be considered rear-delt moves.","images":["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/may/10-best-muscle-building-shoulder-exercies-v2-2-compressed-640xh.jpg"]},{"title":"Seated Overhead Dumbbell Press","description":"Why it made the list: Switching out the barbell for dumbbells on overhead presses works each side independently, making the move more challenging and requiring more input from stabilizer muscles.
